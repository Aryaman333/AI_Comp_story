Welcome to Roomie Roulette, an interactive game designed by Shubhankar Garg, Aryaman Bahukhandi, Piyush Santosh Kulkarni and Rutuja Abhijitq Kale. This game is designed as an interactive novel, where players make choices based on the questions asked by different non-playable characters, which in turn affects the social state in the background. The ultimate goal of the game is to match the player with the best-suited roommate. We hope that this game will serve as a motivator for future research that explores the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and real-world issues such as finding an ideal roommate.
